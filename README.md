<p>Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, one of the early developers of the system adopted for electrical telegraphy.</p>

## Module used
<p>morse_converter.py: The module contains a dictionary with key-value pairs, which map characters to their corresponding Morse code representations. 
This dictionary serves as a reference for the conversion process. Additionally, the module includes a function that converts a given string of text into Morse code.
